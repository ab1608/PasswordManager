# Password Manager Intent

This PasswordManager is my first attempt at building a project using Python.
I have taught myself Python and introductoray programming throughout summer 2020.
This code may not be the best written or well structured but I hope it's a decent first start. 

# Features
- Generate a random password of up to 26 characters.
- Store passwords which are encrypted via an MD5 algorithm.
- Single-user or multi-user versions available with login screens.
